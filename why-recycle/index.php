						<p class="lead mb-0">Plastic pollution is one of the greatest threats to ocean health worldwide. In spite of society’s many efforts to properly dispose of plastic waste, between 4 and 12 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the ocean each year—enough to cover every foot of coastline on the planet. And that amount is expected to more than double in the next 10 years.</p>

            <h2><a href="why-recycle/resource-management.php">Non-renewable Resource Mangagement</a></h2>
            <p class="lead mb-0">Non-renewable resources are sources of energy whose supply or reserves are fixed. These are resources that are used and consumed faster than nature can produce them. It can take billions of years to form these resources, making their use unsustainable. As supply decreases, it becomes uneconomic to use them. So for practical purposes these resources are finite. Recycling and using alternate renewables can help extend their limited supply. </p>

            <p class="lead mb-0">Sustainability is based on a simple principle: Everything that we need for our survival and well-being depends, either directly or indirectly, on our natural environment. Sustainability is important to making sure that we have and will continue to have, the water, materials, and resources to protect human health and our environment.</p>
