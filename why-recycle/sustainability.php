       <p>"Why isn't this plastic utensil recyclable?! IT'S MADE OF PLASTIC!" Even though items ARE recyclable, they may not be recyclable in your area!</p>
				<p>We are limited by our local city and private facilities. While plastic utensils SHOULD be recycled your local facilities may not be able to handle that specific material</p>
				<p>Plastic utensils are made from either polypropylene or hard polystyrene, identifiable by RICs (the numbers in the triangular symbol) 5 and 6, respectively. Hard polystyrene (NOT foamed polystyrene, AKA Styrofoam™) and polypropylene are recyclable in many areas, but as always, you should check your local program’s guidelines about plastic silverware, specifically: Even if the specific RIC is accepted, the size of plastic silverware makes them difficult for recycling machinery to handle, and can render them unrecyclable. Some curbside programs, like Fort Worth’s, will accept plastic utensils, but because plastic forks and knives are so small, some locations, like Easton, PA, will not. If neither your waste hauler nor your local recycling center accepts plastic utensils, you should throw them in the trash after the first use. While it may be tempting to reuse them a few times before tossing them, disposable utensils generally won’t hold up for long before warping and the potential for accumulated bacteria make them unusable.</p>
